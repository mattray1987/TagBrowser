# TagBrowser
A simple application for viewing story and file tags

Tag story files by adding a line like so:

Tags: tag one, tag two, tag three

Tags are not case sensitive. 

Select the folder containing your tagged txt files and the browser will allow you to sort by tag. Double-click a story to open it in your default text editor.
